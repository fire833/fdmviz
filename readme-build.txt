# Instructions to Build the Project

## Prerequisites

NodeJS
Yarn

## Build and Serve Locally

Run the following terminal command from within the `Build` directory
to install the NPM dependencies, build the app, and serve it from localhost.
```
yarn dev
```

This typically serves the webpage at `http://localhost:5173/`, though if that port is occupied it will serve it elsewhere.

## Alternative (Easier): Live URL

The repository is automatically deployed to a GitHub Pages server, located at:

`https://fdmviz.tauser.us/`
